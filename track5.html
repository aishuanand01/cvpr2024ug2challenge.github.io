              <p>Images captured in adverse weather conditions significantly impact the performance of many vision tasks. Rain is a common weather phenomenon that introduces visual degradations to captured images and videos through partial occlusions of objects – in heavy rain, severe occlusion to the background. As most vision algorithms assume clear weather, with no interference of rain, their performance suffers. Deraining is the task of removing such visual degradations so that the images are better suited to the assumptions of downstream vision algorithms, as well as for aesthetic fruition. </p>

              <p>UG<sup>2</sup>+ Track 3 aims to promote the development of novel single image deraining algorithms for real images. The competition will feature diverse and challenging scenarios that include (i) various types of rain conditions (i.e. long and short streaks, various densities and accumulation, with and without rain fog), (ii) large variety of background scenes from urban locations (i.e. buildings, streets, cityscapes) to natural scenery (i.e. forests, plains, hills), (iii) varying degrees of illumination from different times of day, and all of which are captured by (iv) cameras that cover a wide array of resolutions, noise levels, and intrinsic parameters. In a collaboration with the authors of GT-RAIN, we will introduce an additional 15 extra scenes set aside as a benchmark test set. The challenge will be split into three phases (training, validation, and testing), where data corresponding to each phase will be released to the participants. The validation set will consist of 5400 frames covering 18 scenes and the testing set 4500 frames covering 15 scenes. Unlike previous evaluation protocols that were limited to qualitative evaluation on real images, the submissions will be evaluated quantitatively using standard metrics like PSNR and SSIM. The ranking of algorithms will be determined based on evaluation scores on the testing set. The first place winner will be awarded $1000 USD, second place will be awarded $800 USD, and third place $500 USD. </p>

              <p>Recently, UAVs have become a major concern in frontline combat, contraband smuggling, and the endangerment of commercial aircraft, among other areas. Due to their compact size and quiet electric motors, they are difficult to detect by soldiers, law-enforcement and vehicles.</p>

              <p>This challenge aims to address the evolving challenge posed by small unmanned aerial vehicles in imagery and beyond based on a comprehensive Multi-Modal Anti-UAV Dataset (MMAUD). This challenge fills a critical gap in contemporary threat detection methodologies by focusing on drone detection, UAV-type classification, and trajectory estimation. What sets this challenge apart is its integration of diverse sensory inputs, including stereo vision, various LiDARs, radars, and audio arrays.</p>

              <p>The newly introduced dataset in this challenge offers a unique overhead aerial perspective crucial for addressing real-world scenarios with greater fidelity than datasets or challenges captured from specific vantage points using thermal and RGB cameras. Additionally, this MMAUD dataset provides precise ground truth data generated by a survey-graded Leica total station, enhancing its credibility and enabling the confident refinement of algorithms and models—a feature unseen in other datasets or challenges. Our challenge closely simulates real-world scenarios by incorporating ambient sounds from heavy machinery. This approach enhances the solution's applicability, capturing the exact challenges faced during proximity to vehicular operations. This challenge is expected to play a pivotal role in advancing UAV threat detection, classification, trajectory estimation capabilities, and more.</p>

              <p>Participants' solutions will be evaluated in terms of UAV type classification accuracy, 3D trajectory estimation accuracy, cost, and processing time. This evaluation comes from a real need for solutions that are affordable, quick, and accurate, which are highly desired. On the other hand, solutions that involve more sensors, are slow, or prone to errors are not wanted. Participants need to select balanced algorithms from the given options to successfully classify the UAV and estimate its trajectory.</p>

              <p>In the challenge, every participant is required to submit a fact sheet that outlines their methods, data modality used, runtime, model size, and hardware requirements, among other details. After the challenge, all fact sheets will be gathered into a final report to spotlight emerging trends and innovative techniques. Additionally, participants are invited to submit detailed manuscripts about their methods to the workshop.</p>
